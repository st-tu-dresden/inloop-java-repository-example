## Introduction

From [Wikipedia][wiki]:

> In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called
> the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is
> the sum of the two preceding ones:
>
> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

## Task

Your task is to implement the Fibonacci function in Java. As a starting point, use the code
template shown in the editor on the right side (you can also download the template below).

The start of sequence must be implemented so that `fib(0) == 0` and `fib(1) == 1`. Furthermore,
illegal argument values of `x` must be handled by throwing an appropriate exception.
